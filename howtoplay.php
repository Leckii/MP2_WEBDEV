    <h1>HOW TO PLAY</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <p>Welcome, brave knights, to the exhilarating tournament of In-Between!
            Prepare yourselves for ten thrilling rounds of numerical combat!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>In each round, you'll face the challenge of two random numbers. Your task? Decipher whether your secret number lies in-between or not! Guess correctly,
            and you'll be showered with 10 points of glory! But beware, a wrong guess will cast you into the abyss of -5 points.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>But wait, there's more! Should fate decree that both numbers are identical, summon your courage and decide if your number reigns higher or submits lower.
            A correct prediction will bestow upon you 10 points, while a misstep will strip you of 5.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>And lo, should fortune favor you with three identical numbers, rejoice! You shall be granted a jackpot round,
            and the spoils of victory shall bless you with a bountiful 25 points!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Yet, remember this: the path to triumph lies in amassing more points than your fellow knight. May the digits be ever in your favor,
            and let the games begin! Onward, noble knights, to victory and glory!
        </p>
